### How does it work?

⚡**Our events are held over ZOOM**.

💻Download and install ZOOM for desktop or mobile devices https://zoom.us/download

🕰**Please arrive 5-10mins in advance**to ensure you’re connected and ready to go.

🎧**We recommend viewing with headphones**. It is easier to hear people and will be easier for you to ask a question, should you decide.

**🗝Accessibility:**Closed-captioning in English will be available during the event. Our Q&A will be conducted using Zoom’s chat function, with the option to voice your question or have our staff read it. Past events can be viewed on our Youtube Channel, where auto-translation of captions into many languages is available:<https://youtube.com/thebrooklynrail>. If you have questions about access or requests, email madeleine@brooklynrail.org.

**👾Technical difficulties**

We work hard to make sure this is easy and enjoyable for everyone, but technology is not always kind. If you are not happy with the experience, we’ll happily refund any donation you made. We just ask that you let us know how we could have made the experience better for you.
