**Document formatting**

Never use double spaces between sentences. Never use small caps. Never indent paragraphs. These will be added in layout as needed.

Always use directional or “smart” quotation marks. These can be set as default in a word processor’s settings.

**Lists and series**

Always use the serial (Oxford) comma.

For series where internal elements themselves contain punctuation, separate list items with semicolons instead of commas.
