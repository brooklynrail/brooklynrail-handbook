## Document formatting {#document-formatting}

Never use double spaces between sentences. Never use small caps. Never indent paragraphs. These will be added in layout as needed.

Always use directional or “smart” quotation marks. These can be set as default in a word processor’s settings.


## Lists and series {#lists-and-series}

Always use the serial (Oxford) comma.


    Graphite, ink, and crayon

For series where internal elements themselves contain punctuation, separate list items with semicolons instead of commas.


    The colors of the three countries’ flags are red, white, and blue; green, yellow, and blue; and green, white, and red, respectively.


    The lecture circuit included Portland, Maine; St. Paul, Minnesota; and Evanston, Illinois.

When a colon is used within a sentence, the following word should be lowercase, unless it is a proper noun. When a colon introduces two or more sentences, the following word should be capitalized.


## Possessives {#possessives}

Proper nouns ending in “s” take the terminal “s” in possessives


    Jeff Koons’s sculpture, Paris’s Palais Royal

However, place only an apostrophe after plural possessives


    The students’ projects


## Italics vs. quotation marks for titles {#italics-vs-quotation-marks-for-titles}

Use italics for titles of the following:


    Artworks, performances, films, books, plays, operas, exhibitions, television programs, albums, recordings, publications/periodicals/blogs, video games

Use quotation marks for titles of the following:


    Articles, essays, short stories, poems (except if book-length), television episodes, songs, series (of artworks), blog posts

For titles of instrumental musical pieces, italicize descriptive titles, not generic titles


    Beethoven’s Symphony no. 5


    Beethoven’s _Für Elise_


## Conversations {#conversations}

In conversations, use an em dash to signal an interruption, not an ellipsis.


    “I thought I might—”


    “Might what?”

Use ellipses only to indicate faltering speech. Use sparingly; if an ellipsis can be replaced with a period, use a period.

To signal asides or small interruptions in speech—such as laughter—use italicized text in brackets. Capitalization of words in brackets depends on their placement within or after a sentence.

Use [_laughs_] if only the current speaker is laughing, and [_laughter_] if all speakers are laughing.


## Quotations and blockquotes {#quotations-and-blockquotes}

Blockquotes should be used when quoted material exceeds four lines of prose or two lines of verse, and should be offset from the body text. Blockquotes do not need to be enclosed in quotation marks or introduced with a paragraph indent.

When quoting verse in running text, use backslashes to signify line breaks

	“There is a crack in everything/That's how the light gets in."

Epigraphs should not be enclosed in quotation marks but should be offset from the body text. The citation should appear below the quote, left-aligned and introduced by an en dash.

When indicating the omission of text from a quoted passage, use an ellipsis. Ellipses are not necessary at beginnings or ends of quotations. To indicate one or more omitted sentences, use ellipses between brackets: […]

Always use the ellipsis character, not three periods.


## Punctuation with quotation marks {#punctuation-with-quotation-marks}

Periods and commas go inside closing quotation marks. Colons and semicolons go outside quotation marks. The placement of question marks and exclamation points depends on whether the symbol applies to the entire sentence or just to the quoted material.

	She asked, “Are you sure?”

	Which of Shakespeare’s characters said, “All the world’s a stage”?


## Nesting quotation marks {#nesting-quotation-marks}

Always nest single quotation marks within double quotation marks, never the other way around. Do not add an extra space when two marks appear next to each other.


    She told me, “‘Consider the Lobster’ is my favorite essay.”


## Punctuation with parentheses and brackets {#punctuation-with-parentheses-and-brackets}

Generally, all punctuation goes outside the closing parenthesis or bracket. If an entire sentence is contained in parentheses, the period precedes the closing parenthesis.
