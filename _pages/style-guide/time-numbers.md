## When to use numerals {#when-to-use-numerals}

In general, use numerals for the following: dimensions of artworks, ages, days of the month, degrees, percentages, time, and years.

When measurements consist of two or more elements, use numerals, but spell out numbers below ten when giving single dimensions or measurements, even when it includes an ordinary fraction


    8 by 12 inches


    six feet tall


    three-and-a-quarter miles long

Spell out the first nine cardinal and ordinal numbers


    There were eight applicants; he was the sixth.

Use numerals for numbers above nine


    The table was set for 10.

Do not mix numerical styles within a single expression


    nine times out of ten, **not** nine times out of 10


## Centuries {#centuries}

Use numerals for centuries after the ninth. Only use a hyphen when part of a larger phrase


    the sixth century, the 19th century, 20th-century aesthetics.


## Decades {#decades}

Never use apostrophes after numerals


    the 1960s, ’60s, or the sixties, **not** the 1960’s or 60’s


    Note: use a closing apostrophe (as above)


## Dates {#dates}

Use the following order: month-day-year, placing a comma between the day and the year.


    September 30, 2016

If not specifying a day, omit comma


    September 2016

Avoid writing days as ordinals


    September 30, **not** September 30th


## Dates of Artworks {#dates-of-artworks}

In running text, include dates of artworks in parentheses after first mention


    Her iconic work _Au Naturel_ (1994), after which the exhibition is named…

Indicate spans of time with an en dash. If a date spans years within a century, omit the first two digits of the second date. If a date spans across centuries, include all four digits for each date.

(1989 – 91), (1999 – 2001)

If a work’s creation is ongoing, the start date is followed by an en-dash and a space


    (1998 – )

Use “ca.” (not “c.”) to indicate circa dates. In running text, use “ca.” if the artwork date is included in parentheses; otherwise use “about.”


    _White Squares_ (ca. 1948)


## Time of day {#time-of-day}

Use numerals, formatting as follows:


    9 a.m.


    4:30 p.m.

**Special expressions using numerals**

Always write out “percent” (not %). Never write out “dollars” (use $).
