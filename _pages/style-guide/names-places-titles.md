## Capitalization of titles {#capitalization-of-titles}

In titles, capitalize all words except the articles (e.g., “a/an” and “the”) and conjunctions

(e.g., “and,” “but,” “for,” “or”) three letters or fewer (unless in the first word of the

headline or if part of a phrasal verb, e.g., “Lifting Up the Masses.”). Always capitalize

any word following a colon, and the first and last word of a title.


## Capitalization of “the” {#capitalization-of-“the”}

In running text, lowercase “the” preceding the name of an institution, building, residence, business, etc. even if the article is part of the official name.

	The show is at the Museum of Modern Art, New York.

	We visited the Empire State Building.

In running text, do not italicize or capitalize “the” preceding the name of a journal or publication, even if the article is part of the official name. Italicize and capitalize “The” at the beginning of sentences.

	As reported in the _New York Times_

	The article published in the _Brooklyn Rail_

	**But,**

	_The Brooklyn Rail _is a New York-based publication.

In endnote citations, drop “the” from publication titles in most cases

	_Washington Post_

_	New York Review of Books_

_	_

**But,**

_The New Yorker_

Retain the capitalized article in foreign-language publications, and all book and artwork titles.

	She subscribes to _Le Monde _and _El País_.


## Capitalization of first and last names {#capitalization-of-first-and-last-names}

Capitalize first and last names unless the person being discussed prefers a lowercase spelling. Always capitalize a name if it begins a sentence; if this contradicts the preferred spelling, rephrase the sentence.

	I am reading a book by bell hooks.

	**Avoid:** Bell hooks wrote _And There We Wept_ in 1978.


## Capitalization of “Black” {#capitalization-of-“black”}

Capitalize Black when referring to a culture, ethnicity, or group of people. Black with a capital B refers to people of the African diaspora. Do not capitalize when referring to the color black.

	the Black population of South Africa

	Black history

	three black lines on the drawing

If White is used in a comparative context within the same article, capitalize as well.


## Capitalization of names with particle prefixes {#capitalization-of-names-with-particle-prefixes}

Generally, particles that are separated from last names should not be capitalized.

	Charles de Gaulle, Theo van Doesburg, Willem de Kooning

Capitalize these articles if they begin a sentence, but not if they appear in running text.

	De Kooning painted _Woman I_ in 1952.

	_Woman I_, by de Kooning


## Professional and academic titles {#professional-and-academic-titles}

Descriptive titles are generally lowercase (curator, director, associate director, president, professor of art history) but capitalize exact titles.


    Richard Armstrong, the museum’s director


    Richard Armstrong, Director, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and Foundation

The words “museum” and “foundation” are lowercase unless they are part of a proper noun.


## Commas in locations and dates {#commas-in-locations-and-dates}

Cities, states, and years are flanked by commas.


    Andrea Rosen Gallery, New York


    Juniata College Museum of Art, Huntingdon, Pennsylvania


    The meeting was scheduled for July 12, 2004.


## Cardinal directions {#cardinal-directions}

Do not capitalize compass directions, except when part of a proper noun.

	Go west, young man.

	The American West



	northeastern America

	The Northeast

Capitalize “Western” whenever it refers to things characteristic of Western cultures.


## US cities and states {#us-cities-and-states}

Include the name of a state if city is not well-known or if there are two cities by the same name in the United States (Rochester: New York and Minnesota; Portland: Maine and Oregon).

Large cities (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Detroit, etc.) need no states; nor do cities well-known as the home of a famous art collection (New Haven, Marfa); nor, in general, well-known medium-size cities (Nashville, Minneapolis, San Diego).

Applying the above criteria is usually a subjective endeavor. When in doubt, include the name of the state. Final decisions will be made by the managing editor according to frequency or context.


## Countries {#countries}

Add or omit after city name by applying same criteria as given above for U.S. states.


## Birth/death dates and places {#birth-death-dates-and-places}

In running text, it is sometimes appropriate to include the artist’s birth date and place (and death, if applicable). The format should be as follows: (b. 1876, Hobitza, Romania; d. 1957, Paris).

Do not include the present-day name of a city or country, only the name of the city or

country as it was when the artist was born. Use all four numerals for the artist’s birth and death years, even when the century of death is the same as the century of birth.


## Abbreviations {#abbreviations}

In general omit periods for common abbreviations: BA, BFA, MA, MFA (but Ph.D.) BCE/CE, TV, URL, PTSD, ID, NEA, US, EU, NYC, LA, etc. Capitalize all initialisms. Check the American Heritage Dictionary for precedent on acronyms.
