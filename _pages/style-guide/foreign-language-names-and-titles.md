## Personal Names {#personal-names}

Do not anglicize; spell exactly as the person does, including all diacritical marks.


## Titles of Artworks and Books

Write title of work in original language adhering to the rules of sentence-style capitalization for the language in question, in italics as appropriate, followed by the English translation of the title in brackets (no italics for English translation).


    Gustave Flaubert’s _L’Éducation sentimentale_ [A Sentimental Education] was published in 1869.

Only provide English translation following the first mention of title.


## Names of Cities and Countries

Anglicize names whenever a conventional American English-language form exists. Otherwise, spell exactly as in the original language, with all accents.


    Cologne for Köln, Montreal for Montréal, Rome for Roma, Zurich for Zürich

If the name of a city is part of an institutional name, retain the foreign-language spelling.


    Kunsthaus Zürich


## Transliteration

In projects dealing with languages that employ non-Roman alphabets, the managing

editor and contributor should specify a transliteration system.

When the traditional spelling of an artist’s name is not in keeping with the transliteration

system, continue to use the traditional spelling


    Vasily Kandinsky, Kazimir Malevich.


## Other Instances of Foreign Language Word Use

In general, when using a word from a foreign language that is _not_ commonly used in

English, italicize the word and include the English translation of the word in parentheses. Consult the American Heritage Dictionary for precedent.
