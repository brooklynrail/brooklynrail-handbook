title: Uploading print issue PDFs to the web
order: 2
---

Starting in April 2020, we decided to make the print issue of the Brooklyn Rail available as a PDF on the website. This PDF is not the final copy we send to the printers _(that one is too large)_ but rather a more screen-ready PDF that people can explore in a browser.

**How to upload PDFs:**

1. Once an issue is FINAL, the print designer should create and send you a PDF that is sized for the web _(the final print file is too large)_.
1. download the PDF to your computer
1. rename the file to `brooklynrail-issue-[ID].pdf`, replacing `[ID]` with the issue ID. You can find the issue ID in the admin
1. navigate to https://brooklynrail.org/admin/files/ and upload the file.
1. Check that the "view PDF" button is visible on the issue homepage
