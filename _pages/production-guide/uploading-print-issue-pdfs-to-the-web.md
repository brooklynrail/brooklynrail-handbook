title: Uploading print issue PDFs to the web
order: 0
---
Each print issue of the Brooklyn Rail has an associated PDF. Recently, we've started archiving them in a central location on the server.

**How to upload PDFs:**

1. Once an issue is FINAL, the print designer should create and send you a PDF that is sized for the web _(the final print file is too large)_.
1. download the PDF to your computer
1. rename the file to `brooklynrail-issue-[ID].pdf`, replacing `[ID]` with the issue ID. You can find the issue ID in the admin
1. navigate to https://brooklynrail.org/admin/files/ and upload the file.
1. Check that the "view PDF" button is visible on the issue homepage
