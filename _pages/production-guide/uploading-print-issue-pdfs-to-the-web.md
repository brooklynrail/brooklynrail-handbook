title: Uploading print issue PDFs to the web
order: 2
---
Starting in April 2020, we decided to make the print issue of the Brooklyn Rail available as a PDF on the website. This PDF is not the final copy we send to the printers *(that one is too large)* but rather a more screen-ready PDF that people can explore in a browser.

**Note:** the max file size is `10mb`

**How to upload PDFs:**

1. Once an issue is FINAL, the print designer should create and send you a PDF that is sized for the web *(less than `10mb`)*
2. Download the PDF to your computer.
3. Find the Issue ID *(e.g. #198)* for the issue in the admin <https://brooklynrail.org/admin/>
4. Change the filename to read `brooklynrail-issue-[ID].pdf`, replacing `[ID]` with the Issue ID.
5. Upload the file in the "files" section of the Rail admin <https://brooklynrail.org/admin/files/>
6. Clear the homepage cache at <https://brooklynrail.org/admin/>
7. Check that the "view PDF" button on the left side of the homepage is visible
