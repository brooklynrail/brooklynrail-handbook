All images for each issue should be stored in the Images folder within the Issue folder, sorted by section. Many section editors provide their own images when they send their content. If this is the case, make sure the images are accompanied by a caption sheet that clearly identifies file names and which article each image is for.

Images for other sections, such as ArtSeen, Features, and Critics Page, will usually need to be gathered by office staff.

**i. Acquiring Press Images**

Free press images can be used for interviews and reviews of current, upcoming, or recent shows and exhibitions. Most large institutions and museums (such as MoMA or the Whitney) have online password protected press pages. With a press login, images can be downloaded without contacting the press office.  (The Met does not have a press site and must be contacted for each show.)

Galleries will provide press images upon request, usually through WeTransfer or Dropbox. It is important to download these materials onto the server when they are received, as the download links do expire eventually. Galleries tend to send materials more quickly if a phone call is made, rather than an email.

It is most efficient to contact galleries and museums for ArtSeen images once the ToC has been built up partway through the month. This way, they can all be contacted during the same day. Once images are received, they should be downloaded into the Images/ArtSeen folder and stored in the correct article folder.

**ii. Preparing Images for Print**

Within each section folder, images to accompany articles should be clearly marked and all images that will not be used should be stored in an Extras folder. Most sections do not need to be divided into separate article folders. Features and ArtSeen should be divided by article, as they have so many images. Once each section is complete, the images can be copied into a new Grayscale folder within the section folder. Use the Grayscale droplet to reformat all images for the designer. This will format all images as grayscale jpegs at 300dpi.

Whenever reformatting images, use a new file and never save over the original

**iii. Preparing Images for Web**

All images must be resized before uploading to the website. In addition, each article needs one banner and one thumbnail. Featured interviews also need a homepage banner.

The Web Images folder should mirror the Images folder, but should only contain resized images

**iv. Captions**

Section editors that provide their own images will provide caption sheets as well—make sure that their captions conform to house style and that they are clearly linked to file names. 

Caption sheets for Features, ArtSeen, and (usually) Critics Page will have to be built in office.

Caption Style for artworks:

Artist Name, Title, Year. Medium, Dimensions. Copyright. Photo: Photographer Name. Courtesy Institution Name.

See Editorial Supplement for more detailed caption information

**v. Image Rights and Restrictions**

When sourcing images outside of current press coverage, be careful to seek out the copyright status of the image. Images that are in the public domain can be reproduced for free.  Whether or not an image is in the public domain depends on when it was created, who created it, and what jurisdiction it falls under. 

Reproduction rights for images that are not in the public domain must be secured from the copyright holder or their representative agency. 

It is important to note that just because an artwork is in the public domain does not mean that the photograph of the artwork is in the public domain. Many museums maintain copyrights over photographs of works in their collection. A notable exception is the Met, which allows free download and use of images of works in its collection whose copyrights have expired. For historical photographs in the public domain, check the Library of Congress digital archive, or any other national library collection—they will often provide free downloads of public domain images.

Large museums and artist estates outsource the management of image copyrights to agencies such as VAGA or ArtRES. When contacting these agencies for quotes, make sure to ask for a nonprofit discount, and to take into account the overall budget for images for the issue. To save time when dealing with foreign museums and agencies, check for agencies within the U.S. that represent the same estates or collections—you will ultimately be directed to the U.S. agency for a final contract. 

After an image contract is signed or an invoice is received, give the physical document to the Managing Director for processing and archiving.

Always ask permission before cropping, bleeding, or overlaying text on an image
